    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Love penetration testing, DefCon, bug bounty programs and scrapping through lines
of code to find vulnerabilities? Then we might have the right opening for you!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here at Namshi we&rsquo;re committed to continuously improve our security posture, by
either <a href="/blog/2018/05/16/introducing-the-namshi-bug-bounty-program/">collaborating with security researchers across the globe</a> or with in-house expertise.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we would like to hire a security researcher that can help
us from this perspective: we see security as being a topic that will only gain additional
importance as time goes by, and we&rsquo;re committed to dedicating the right amount of time,
and money, to the cause :)</p>

<p>As a <strong>Security Engineer</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be tasked with running internal assessments, ranging
from <em>pentesting</em> our cloud infrastructure to social engineering around the office,
review our security policies and define the best strategy to improve our posture.
In addition to that, you will be actively collaborating with external researchers
through our HackerOne program, which is going to be directly under your responsibility.
On top of this, as the months will go by, you will probably spend time training
both our technical and non-technical staff to raise awareness and make sure we
got the basics covered.</p>

<p>Been into it since Kali was Backtrack? Spend time going through public bounty programs
to hack your way to a reward? Want to take on the responsibility of shaping Namshi&rsquo;s
defense? Then weâ€™re definitely a match!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Love microservices, NodeJS and distributed systems? Then we might have the right
opening for you!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here at Namshi we&rsquo;re constantly trying to renovate our stack by using the best
from the open source ecosystem: from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, our stack bleeds with
interesting tools to work with.</p>

<p>As a Sr. Backend Engineer, you&rsquo;ll be tasked to work on a spectrum of services
ranging from our customer-facing APIs to tools that power our logistics infrastructure.
We are a very pragmatic and experienced team, so from time to time you will see
engineers busy TDDing on a feature, whereas other times we&rsquo;re <em>straight to live</em>.
We pride of being a heterogeneous team that&rsquo;s experienced to know how and when to
abstract.</p>

<p>We run a Service-Oriented architecture with 100+ microservices where JS plays a
huge part: <a href="https://stackshare.io/namshi">our stack is comprised of many different tools</a>
and we&rsquo;re always up to experimenting in light of new, harder challenges.</p>

<p>Some of the things our backend team has been working over the past few months:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2017/05/28/rewriting-the-catalog-api/">rewriting one of our most sensitive APIs</a>, bringing the median response time down to 30ms</li>
<li>moving <a href="/blog/2017/02/06/towards-high-availability-and-beyond/">wonky pieces of our infrastructure</a> towards high-availability</li>
<li>releasing some interesting open-source <a href="https://github.com/namshi/stackdriver-pushgateway">backend bits</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Most of our backend apps are built with NodeJS, although some of the apps
still kick it in Symfony2 or pythonic boots. With a fleet of 100+ microservices, we&rsquo;re
generally very busy trying to innovate as much as possible &mdash; and refactoring when
we need to pay our technical debt back.</p>

<p>Understand the HTTP protocol? Like deploying microservices on kubernetes? Async
programming doesn&rsquo;t scare you? Then we&rsquo;re definitely a match!</p>

<p>It is no news that we&rsquo;ve been banking on the JS ecosystem
for a few years: from rolling out our first angular apps in 2013 to using React
Native in our android app, we&rsquo;ve been very busy trying to push our frontends
as far as possible.</p>

<p>We run a Service-Oriented architecture where JS plays a huge part: most of our
services are either SPAs or small NodeJS-backed APIs, and <strong>JavaScript is king</strong> at
Namshi.</p>

<p>We would like to work with someone who has a very strong background in the language,
who&rsquo;s been battling on the frontend for a few years and is not afraid to dive into

    <id>http://namshi.github.io/blog/2017/03/09/currently-hiring-backend-mobile-developers-dubai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re currently looking for some help in a couple areas of our tech team &mdash; why
don&rsquo;t <strong>you</strong> join us?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Mobile</h2>

<p>Getting into the specifics, we&rsquo;ve been working with an external mobile team (3rd party)
that wrote our apps from scratch, setup an efficient testing &amp; CI strategy and a
very solid deployment workflow &mdash; as a matter of fact, we&rsquo;re very proud of our
crash rate on both platforms, with android leading at 0.05%.</p>

<p>We are comfortable with the quality of our apps and the pace of development but,
in order to take them to the next level, it&rsquo;s clear to us that we need our own
team to do that: commitment, communication and going the extra-mile are definitely
different when you&rsquo;re part of the organization.</p>

<p>On the long run the team is going to be comprised of a few engineers and a lead,
so we&rsquo;d initially like to start with:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 <strong>lead mobile developer</strong>, who should ideally have good experience on both platforms</li>
<li>1 <strong>senior iOS developer</strong></li>
<li>1 <strong>senior android developer</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The <strong>lead mobile engineer</strong> should ideally be a very hands-on, seasoned mobile
engineer with experience leading / forming a team &mdash; he will need to
help building the team, setting the right direction, overseeing development
on both platforms and coordinating with other teams (ie. backend
or product management) on feature development and aligning priorities. We expect
him to spend around 50% of his time on development (this is still a <em>hands-on</em> position),
and the other 50% on the team, teaching practices, reviewing pull requests and so on.</p>

<p>We expect from <strong>senior engineers</strong> to be able to write clean, testable code that&rsquo;s
hard to break &mdash; a few years (4+) of experience are definitely needed (say, you
should have bumped into <code>@autoreleasepool</code> before ;&ndash;)) and you
should be very familiar with different design patterns (Delegate, Facade, etc),
concepts such as mock objects and various tools to support your workflow (ie. CI
pipelines).</p>

<h2>Backend</h2>

<p>We could definitely use some help in our backend team :)</p>

<p>Even though we&rsquo;re not in a rough spot, we would like to be able to expand
our pipeline and be able to add even more seniority to the team: our usual &ldquo;backend problem&rdquo;
is that we have lots of things we&rsquo;d like to work on / experiment with but not a lot
of engineers, thus we eventually end up giving those projects up or delaying them
too much.</p>

<p>The main technologies you would be working with are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Solr</li>
<li>Golang</li>
<li>Symfony2</li>
<li>a bit of frontend with either Angular or React</li>
</ul>


<p>all of these in the context of our microservice-based SOA: we currently employ
50+ service in production, mostly deployed in Docker containers through Google&rsquo;s
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>Here we would keep in consideration candidates for both a <strong>lead</strong> and a
<strong>senior</strong> position: the current team is working well and we haven&rsquo;t felt the
need to hire a lead engineer over the past few months, but we&rsquo;re open to the
idea if we find the right candidate.</p>

<p>Needless to say, both position would be <strong>quite hands-on</strong> :)</p>

let&rsquo;s have a chat!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks, here at <a href="https://www.namshi.com">Namshi</a> we&rsquo;re currently looking
to beef our team up &mdash; without further ado, let me quickly go through both
of them!</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sr. DevOps engineer</strong>: we run our entire stack on AWS, and 99% of our
services run in Docker containers orchestrated via <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>:
a big chunk of our infrastructure is provisioned through <a href="https://saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a>
and we like to keep things simple, reliable and robust &mdash; inspired by
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/05/dystopia-as-a-service">Netflix&rsquo;s dystopian architecture</a>.
We believe in fault-tolerant, reactive architectures that don&rsquo;t care about a
server going down, as others will be able to take on the load, or automated checks
will make sure new HW comes online &mdash; and that&rsquo;s how we setup our live infrastructure,
where a sizable chunk of our services runs through spot instances, with confidence :)
We are now looking for someone who can help us lifting the team a step further, playing
with tools like:</p>

<ul>
<li>golang / python / bash</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Kubernets / Swarm / Mesos</li>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>SaltStack / Ansible / Chef</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In the past 18 months we&rsquo;ve worked on a few interesting challenges such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>implementing ChatOps</li>
<li>utilizing containers on our live infrastructure</li>
<li>integrating Terraform to automate tasks / provisioning</li>
<li>reduced our AWS bill, while growing as a company, by writing more efficient
applications and introducing spot instances in our fleet</li>
</ul>


<p>This gives you an overview of the kind of stuff we would love you to work on:
we think of DevOps engineers as a mix between software developers
and system administrators, so we&rsquo;d like you to know a bit of both :)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>(Sr.) JS engineer</strong>: it is no news that we&rsquo;ve been exploring the JS ecosystem
for a few years now: from rolling out our first angular apps in 2013 to testing
React Native in the past months, we&rsquo;ve been very busy trying to push our frontends
as far as possible.
We run a Service-Oriented architecture where JS plays a huge part: most of our
services are either SPAs or small NodeJS-backed APIs, and JavaScript is king at
Namshi.
We would like to work with someone who has a very strong background in the language,
who&rsquo;s been battling on the frontend for a few years and is not afraid to dive into
Node, if required.
Some of the things our frontend team has been working over the past few weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li>React Native</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>MobX</li>
<li>isomorphic JavaScript</li>
<li>AMP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Most of our frontend apps are built with Angular, although we&rsquo;re heavily experimenting
with React, even for our internal tools. With a fleet of 50+ microservices, we&rsquo;re
generally very busy trying to innovate as much as possible.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re open to very promising, junior candidates even though we&rsquo;re currently hoping
to find someone with a few years of experience on his / her back &mdash; if you feel you
do not have the experience but have the right attitude, then let&rsquo;s definitely have
a chat.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for? Drop a line at <code>work-in-tech@namshi.com</code> and let&rsquo;s
start this journey together!</p>
