Looking for a fresh new start in 2019? We might have
the right opening for you!

<!-- more -->

In order to support the growth of our business, we're currently
beefing up our entire tech department, with the intention of
developing even [faster services](/blog/2017/05/28/rewriting-the-catalog-api/)
and delivering an even more [amazing customer experience](http://tech.namshi.io/blog/2018/08/16/improve-our-exchange-process/):
the end goal is to re-organize the structure of our team
(which has always been split by skillset, as in "mobile", "backend", etc)
and mimic the [squad framework](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/), where technical teams are split
by "business function".
We're never going to employ thousands
of engineers but, as we feel the need to build a bigger tech
pipeline and consequently hire additional software engineers,
we think the squad framework provides a good structure for
a bigger organization.

So, lots of hiring coming up here at Namshi: mobile, SRE, frontend, backend...   ...you name it, we're probably hiring :)

Our mobile team, led by [Abdul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannancs112/), is playing around with React Native
and works on a daily basis with Swift and the standard
Android toolkit (even though they've been flirting with
Kotlin every now and then): their mission is to make
our mobile apps blazing fast, smooth and as crash-free as possible.

On the frontend side of things, our team
develops [amazing web UXes](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-145/which-brands-have-most-user-friendly-mobile-sites-united-arab-emirates-and-saudi-arabia/)
and internal tools used within the company: our frontenders
eat React for breakfast and are spearheaded by [Shidhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shidhincr), our
most senior frontend engineer.

On the backend, [Carles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlesi)
and [Ayham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayham-alzoubi-06516a52/)
lead a tight-knit team that focuses on delivering HTTP APIs for
our clients to consume: the team deals with scalability
and performance issues and solve problems that span across the
whole domain, mostly with NodeJS, Python and Go.

Last but not least, our SREs
build infrastructures for more than 100 services, all
deployed through Docker containers orchestrated by
Kubernetes. It is almost unbelievable to see what they
allow others teams to do, especially considering
the team is extremely small, as [Abdelrahman](/team/#Abdelrahman%20Shiddo) and
[Andrey](/team/#Andrey%20Komarov) are our only SREs.

Sounds interesting enough? Then drop us a line at *work-in-tech@namshi.com*
and let's have a chat!

Oh, I almost forgot -- a couple more things before leaving:

* most of our engineers are quite senior, so we'd like
to "diversify" and hire less experienced candidates:
juniors and intermediates are our ideal candidates as
of now. If you consider yourself a senior and would like
to apply, feel free to reach out, as we might be able to
work something out :)
* I wrote about our hiring process a while ago but most
of it still stands, so I'd recommend you to have a look at
our post "[Get that job at Namshi](/blog/2016/12/06/get-that-job-at-namshi/)"

Adios!
